            <li>Contrast: Christina did a great job with contrast on her website. The links in the header might be slightly too light.</li>
            <li>Repitition: All of Christina's pages have the same header and same page layout. The header is nice and simple.</li>
            <li>Alignment: I think the website's alignment could use some work. The first page's header is centered while the photo is left aligned. Most of the rest of the website is left aligned, which I'm personally not a fan of. The last page seems to
                be centered.</li>
            <li>Proximity: The proximity is good. Nothing seems too close or far apart.</li>
        </ol>

        <strong style="text-align: center;">Website has within it:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Header: The pages all share the same header and it looks very clean.</li>
            <li>Main: The main seems consistent throughout the website.</li>
            <li>Nav: The navbar is consistent and clean throughout the website as well.</li>
        </ol>

        <ol>
            <li>Contrast: Joseph did a good job with contrast. I do think that the font color could be slightly brighter though. I'm unsure if it would pass the contrast test.</li>
            <li>Repitition: Each page has a similar layout. Same nav bar and same color theme. Very consistant.</li>
            <li>Alignment: The website is very nicely aligned. Everything seems to be centered.</li>
            <li>Proximity: The proximity is good. Nothing catches my eye as weird.</li>
        </ol>
